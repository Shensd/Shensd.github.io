                        The Research Experience for Undergraduates is a program sponsored by the National Science Foundation to encourage
                        research to be conducted by undergraduate students in a growing number of different fields. I participated in the
                        NDSU hosted Cybersecurity REU and developed, conducted, and wrote about the use of machine learning in post attack 
                        forensic analysis. My project was specifically about the use of unsupervised learning on profiling users by Bash 
                        history. This project is currently in the process of being published by IEEE.
