                    I am currently attending my sophomore year at North Dakota State University, the computer science 
                    course is heavily focused on Java, but also includes use of languages such as C# and C.

                        The NDSU Cybersecurity Student Association is a club dedicated to peer learning oriented towards cybersecurity. 
                        Club members participate in student lead lessons and compete in hacking competitions. The club also focuses on 
                        team programming and technology along with it.

                    <p><b>NDSU Cybersecurity Research Experience for Undergraduates</b></p>
                    <p>
                        The Research Experience for Undergraduates is a program sponsored by the National Science Foundation to encourage
                        research to be conducted by undergraduate students in a growing number of different fields. I participated in the
                        NDSU hosted Cybersecurity REU and developed, conducted, and wrote about the use of machine learning in post attack 
                        forensic analysis. My project was specifically about the use of unsupervised learning on profiling users by Bash 
                        history. This project is currently in the process of being published by IEEE.
