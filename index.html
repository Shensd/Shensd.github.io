                    <h2>Education</h2>
                    <p><b>BS Computer Science,</b> North Dakota State University, Expected Fall 2021</p>
                    <p>I
                        am currently attending my junior year at North Dakota State University,
                        the computer science course is heavily focused on Java, but also
                        includes the use of languages such as C#, C, Typescript, and Python.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Recognized as a student of distinction within the NDSU Department of Computer Science</li>
                        <li>Placed on the Dean’s List each of the four semesters completed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Experience</h2>
                    <p><b>JES2 Development Intern,</b> IBM, June 2020 to Present</p>
                    <p>JES2
                        is a component of z/OS, an enterprise mainframe operating system
                        developed by IBM. JES2's functionality within z/OS is to act as a core
                        manager for batch jobs executed on the system, and as such, working with
                        JES2 requires an all-encompassing understanding of the mainframe
                        ecosystem. This internship allowed me to work with mainframes and many
                        of their associated technologies, such as z/OS, z/VM, and ISPF. It also
                        allowed me to work with several IBM languages, those being HLASM, JCL,
                        and others internal to IBM. I had no experience with the style of
                        computing that mainframes require before this internship, so it has been
                        a wonderful opportunity to be given a solid familiarity with the
                        system.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gained experience and familiarity with the mainframe ecosystem</li>
                        <li>Worked with many different technologies including HLASM, Z/VM, Z/OS, and ISPF</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Extracurricular</h2>
                    <p><b>President,</b> NDSU Cybersecurity Student Association, May 2020 to Present</p>

                        focuses on team programming and technology along with it.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learned leadership skills through leading lessons and organizing meetings</li>
                        <li>Self and peer taught in many areas of cybersecurity </li>
                        <li>Worked in a team environment on several software development projects</li>

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <p><b>Cybersecurity Research Experience for Undergraduates, </b> North Dakota State University, June
                        2019 - August 2019</p>
                    <p>The
                        Research Experience for Undergraduates is a program sponsored by the
                        National Science Foundation to encourage research to be conducted by
                        undergraduate students in a growing number of different fields. I
                        participated in the NDSU hosted Cybersecurity REU and developed,
                        conducted, and wrote about the use of machine learning in post attack
                        forensic analysis. My project was specifically about the use of
                        unsupervised learning on profiling users by Bash history. My paper <em>Use of Bash History
                            Novelty Detection for Identification of Similar Source Attack Generation </em>is
                        set to be published at the 19th IEEE International Conference on Trust,
                        Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (IEEE TrustCom
                        2020) at the end of this December.</p>
                    <h2>Achievements</h2>
                    <p><b>Cyber Skyline’s NCL Regular Season Fall 2020 CTF Competition,</b> placed 13th of 6000+ players
                    </p>
                    <p>A
                        Capture the Flag competition is a competition in where players are
                        given a wide array of hacking challenges with the goal of having players
                        use many different cybersecurity skills to solve problems to get an end
                        "flag." An example of a basic challenge would be to use an SQLI
                        vulnerability to leak a database that holds a specific string that is
                        the final flag. Cyber Skyline's NCL CTF competition consisted of
                        categories including cryptography, reverse engineering, log analysis,
                        password cracking, web application exploitation, and several others. In
                        the individual section of the competition, I placed 13th out of 6,011
                        players nationwide.</p>
                    <p><b>2019 National Cyber Summit Cyber Cup Challenge,</b> placed 2nd out of 10+ college teams</p>
                    <p>The
                        National Cyber Summit Cyber Cup Challenge is a team-based CTF taking
                        place live during the Annual National Cyber Summit conference. I was the
                        team captain of a team consisting of 4 members. We worked as a team to
                        solve cybersecurity problems in several different categories, with a
                        strong focus on web application exploitation.</p>
                    <p><b>Digi-Key Collegiate Computing Competition 2020,</b> placed 3rd out of 18 college teams</p>
                    <p>Digi-Key's
                        Collegiate Computing Competition (DKC^3) is a programming competition
                        that consists of three main events: short programming problems, long
                        programming problems, and word problems. Each segment of the competition
                        is time-constrained and as such teams must strategize which problems to
                        pour resources into and which ones to ignore. The 2020 competition was
                        my first time participating and our team placed 3rd out of the 18
                        college teams that were in attendance.</p>
                    <h2>Other Competitions</h2>
                    <p><b>National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition,</b> particiated 2019 and 2020</p>
                    <p>The
                        National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) is a college level
                        cyber defense competition in which teams are given a mock business
                        infrastructure purposely built with a large number of security
                        vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities must be found and fixed while a
                        team of penetration testers attempts to breach the network and leak
                        information. Technologies change every year, but Active Directory and
                        Linux servers appear frequently. I have participated in this competition
                        as both a team member (2019) and a team captain (2020).</p>
                    <p><b>National Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition, </b> participated 2019 and 2020</p>
                    <p>The
                        National Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC) is a
                        college-level cyber offense competition in which teams are presented a
                        mock business infrastructure that they must perform a penetration test
                        on and then create a report of findings. The competition enforces
                        real-world penetration testing considerations, such as losing points for
                        knocking services offline and receiving emails from a point of contact
                        asking for test updates. The report filed at the end is entirely crafted
                        by teams, without being given any sort of direction or template,
                        requiring research into how penetration test reports are written in
                        real-world penetration tests. I have participated as a team captain two
                        years in a row, leading two different teams of 6 individuals each.</p>

                                general-purpose scripting. I also use it for automation of scripts for
                                applications in daily use and penetration testing, an example of this

                                have participated in a large number of cybersecurity competitions, both
                                in a team and individual settings. These have included more game-like
                                hacking such as capture the flag competitions, but also more real-world
                                such as the Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition, which is a
                                team-based competition where a pentest is performed on a mock business's
                                architecture and a final penetration testing report is written. My area
                                of interest in penetration testing lies heavily in reverse engineering
                                of both desktop binaries and the deobfuscation of web scripts.</p>
