### **C++**, 6 years experience (2017)

My primary development language is C++, I tend to use it largely with networking and hardware but have also used it with libraries such as OpenGL. Some specific projects created with C++ would include things like PSBB, an HTTP web server written from scratch using raw sockets, and an [Arduino library for working with the HID5455 family of RFID scanners.](https://github.com/Shensd/HID5455-Arduino)

### **Javascript/Node.js**, 7 years experience (2016)

I have used Node.js and companion languages in many different applications, but the area of which I have done the most development is the creation of chat bots for social applications such as [Discord](https://discord.gg/), which is a voice and chat application platform with rich support for text and voice chat bots. An example of my work in this area can be seen in [Tohru Bot](https://tohru.fun/), a music and moderation bot for general server use.

### **Python**, 6 years experience (2017)

I have used python extensively in networking, web scraping, and general-purpose scripting. I also use it for automation of scripts for applications in daily use and penetration testing, an example of this being [icecold](https://github.com/Shensd/icecold), a website wordlist generator. I utilized the python machine learning library Scikit-Learn for the machine learning aspect of my paper Use of Novelty Detection on Bash History for Identification of Similar Source Generation in Post Attack Forensic Analysis.

### **Penetration Testing**, 5 years experience (2018)

I have participated in a large number of cybersecurity competitions, both in a team and individual settings. These have included more game-like hacking such as capture the flag competitions, but also more real-world such as the Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition, which is a team-based competition where a pentest is performed on a mock business's architecture and a final penetration testing report is written. My area of interest in penetration testing lies heavily in reverse engineering of both desktop binaries and the deobfuscation of web scripts.

### **HTML5/CSS3/Javascript**, 8 years experience (2015)

I have used front end web development technologies frequently throughout my career as a developer, and I find myself very comfortable using them across a variety of applications. My strength within this area is bringing design ideas to life in the form of websites. Some websites I have created in the past include [tohru.fun](https://tohru.fun) and [insomniactf.com](https://insomniactf.com).

* User Experience
