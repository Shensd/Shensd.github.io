### **JES2 Development Intern**, IBM, June 2020 to December 2020

JES2 is a component of z/OS, an enterprise mainframe operating system developed by IBM. JES2's functionality within z/OS is to act as a core manager for batch jobs executed on the system, and as such, working with JES2 requires an all-encompassing understanding of the mainframe ecosystem. This internship allowed me to work with mainframes and many of their associated technologies, such as z/OS, z/VM, and ISPF. It also allowed me to work with several IBM languages, those being HLASM, JCL, and others internal to IBM. I had no experience with the style of computing that mainframes require before this internship, so it has been a wonderful opportunity to be given a solid familiarity with the system.

* Gained experience and familiarity with the mainframe ecosystem
* Worked with many different technologies including HLASM, Z/VM, Z/OS, and ISPF
