### **Gradute Assistant**, North Dakota State University, August 2021 - Present

As a cybersecurity focused graduate assistant I am currently working with several other graduate students on developing a distributed, novel attack system. Due to the nature of the project I am not allowed to discuss details of what system it currently targets or in what respects it is novel. The system is being developed in C++ with elements also implemented in Lua, and because of its distributed nature we are also working with build systems on both Linux and Windows. 

### **Cybersecurity Research Experience for Undergraduates**, North Dakota State University, June 2019 - August 2019

The Research Experience for Undergraduates is a program sponsored by the National Science Foundation to encourage research to be conducted by undergraduate students in a growing number of different fields. I participated in the NDSU hosted Cybersecurity REU and developed, conducted, and wrote about the use of machine learning in post attack forensic analysis. My project was specifically about the use of unsupervised learning on profiling users by Bash history. My paper Use of Bash History Novelty Detection for Identification of Similar Source Attack Generation was published at the 19th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (IEEE TrustCom 2020) at the end of December 2020.
