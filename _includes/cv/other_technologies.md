### **Virtualization**

I have utilized virtualization extensively for use in both development and cybersecurity, as virtual machines are incredibly beneficial for running things such as Kali Linux for penetration testing or Flare VM for reverse engineering purposes. I have experience with setting up and using desktop clients and bare metal server hypervisors.
