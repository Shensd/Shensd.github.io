### **National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition**, Particiated 2019 and 2020

The National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) is a college level cyber defense competition in which teams are given a mock business infrastructure purposely built with a large number of security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities must be found and fixed while a team of penetration testers attempts to breach the network and leak information. Technologies change every year, but Active Directory and Linux servers appear frequently. I have participated in this competition as both a team member (2019) and a team captain (2020).

### **National Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition**, Participated 2019 and 2020

The National Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC) is a college-level cyber offense competition in which teams are presented a mock business infrastructure that they must perform a penetration test on and then create a report of findings. The competition enforces real-world penetration testing considerations, such as losing points for knocking services offline and receiving emails from a point of contact asking for test updates. The report filed at the end is entirely crafted by teams, without being given any sort of direction or template, requiring research into how penetration test reports are written in real-world penetration tests. I have participated as a team captain two years in a row, leading two different teams of 6 individuals each.
