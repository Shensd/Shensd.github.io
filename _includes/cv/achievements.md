### **Cyber Skyline’s NCL Fall 2021 Individual CTF Competition**, Placed 10th out of 6400+ players

A Capture the Flag competition is a competition in where players are given a wide array of hacking challenges with the goal of having players use many different cybersecurity skills to solve problems to get an end "flag." An example of a basic challenge would be to use an SQLI vulnerability to leak a database that holds a specific string that is the final flag. Cyber Skyline's NCL CTF competition consisted of categories including cryptography, reverse engineering, log analysis, password cracking, web application exploitation, and several others. In the individual section of the competition, I placed 10th out of 6,475 players nationwide.

### **2022 National Cyber Summit Cyber Cup Challenge**, Placed 1st out of 28 college teams

The National Cyber Summit Cyber Cup Challenge is a team-based CTF taking place live during the Annual National Cyber Summit conference. The CTF is hosted and put together by Hack The Box. I was the team captain of a team consisting of four members. We worked as a team to solve cybersecurity problems in several different categories, with a strong focus on reverse engineering and web application exploitation.

### **Cyber Skyline’s NCL Spring 2023 Team CTF Competition**, Placed 4th out of 316 teams

I was the team captain of a team of six members. The NCL team competition contains the same categories of problems as the individual, but they are made more difficult due to teams being more than a single person. This experience not only taught me cybersecurity skills but also leadership skills as I worked with and coordinated with my team.

### **Digi-Key Collegiate Computing Competition 2021**, Placed 3rd out of 15 college teams

Digi-Key's Collegiate Computing Competition (DKC^3) is a programming competition that consists of three main events: short programming problems, long programming problems, and word problems. Each segment of the competition is time-constrained and as such teams must strategize which problems to pour resources into and which ones to ignore. The 2021 competition was my second time participating and our team placed 3rd out of the 15 college teams that were in attendance.
