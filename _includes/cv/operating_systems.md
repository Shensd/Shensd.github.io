### **Linux**, 5 years experience (2016)

I run Ubuntu Linux as my daily driver operating system, and have extensive experience using Linux in both development and in general daily tasks. Most of my experience with Linux is within the Debian family of distros, but I am confident in my ability to learn the ecosystem of new Linux distros rather quickly.

* Heavy experience with Bash/Shell
* Ubuntu/Debian Linux
* Server and Desktop Experience

### **Windows**, 10 years experience (2011)

Being as Microsoft Windows is the most popular operating system on the market, I have used it for much of my computing career. I have experience with using Windows both as a daily driver and a development ecosystem, as I have a decent amount of experience using tools such as Powershell and Visual Studio.

* Experience with Powershell
* Windows 7/10
* Visual Studio
